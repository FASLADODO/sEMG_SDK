% function description:
% Input:
% 		[Rawdata], (2000t) X nCh, 
% 						rawdata from selected sensor channels
% 		[featuresCell], a cell of strings, which are the name of selected features
% 						and also transform them as their features extraction functions' name
% 		[LW], the length of a features-extraction window
% 		[LI], the increasing length of a features-extraction window

% Output:
%		[sampleMatrix], (nCh*nFe) X M, looks like
% 			(ch1f1)1, (ch1f2)1, (ch1f3)1, ..., (ch2f1)1, (ch2f2)1, (ch2f3)1
% 			(ch1f1)2, (ch1f2)2, (ch1f3)2, ..., (ch2f1)2, (ch2f2)2, (ch2f3)2
% 			. . . . . .
% 			. . . . . .
% 			(ch1f1)M, (ch1f2)M, (ch1f3)M, ..., (ch2f1)M, (ch2f2)M, (ch2f3)M
% 			Representation Explanation:
% 				nCh, the number of selected Channels
% 				nFe, the number of selected Features
% 				M,   the number of sliding windows
% 				nWindows, the number of sliding windows
